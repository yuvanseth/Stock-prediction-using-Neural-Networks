# Stock-prediction-using-Neural-Networks

This project uses Yahoo Finance data to train a neural network to predict whether the USD-INR pair will close higher or lower the next day, given the closing prices of ‘n’ previous days

The best time-frame and day window is identified using cross-validation, and currently the win perceantage is at 56% on the test set

The project is ongoing
